Everyone has their own way of aligning their sanger sequencing results. Our plan is to make a command line tool which takes as input all sanger sequencing runs and all template plasmids (genbank) and report where things aligned.  Similar to the BLASTn web-portal but no formatting is needed.  Just point the script at the zip files and get a report of how things panned out.
